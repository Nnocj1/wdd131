            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p> And it came to pass that Nephi said unto his father, 
                <br/>I will go and do the things which the Lord has commanded for 
                <br/>I know that the Lord giveth no commandment unto the children of men, save he shall 
                <br/>prepare a way that they may accomplish the thing which He has commanded them.
            </p>

            <h2>John 3:16</h2>
            <p>For God so love the world. That He gave his only begotten Son Jesus Christ.
                <br/>That whoso believe in him should not perish but have an everlasting life.
